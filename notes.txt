Needed to fit on one plate to reduce the variation, so technical replicates were restricted


Address the normality of the data, add a line in the manuscript and write the rebuttal.

Regarding Normality of data: 
Shapiro Wilks testing was performed on each of the datasets, which indicated that most of the datasets were not normally distributed.
Due to the non-normality of the data and the small sample size, the non-parametric bootstrap method was selected for the analysis.
This method has been shown to be robust to non-normality and small sample size, and outperforms t-tests and rank sum tests in these situations.
